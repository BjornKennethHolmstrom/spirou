## Next Steps for Building Spirou

Now that your integration is working and deployment is set up, here are some suggested next steps to continue building Spirou:

### 1. Enhance the AI Experience

1. **Response Formatting**: Style AI responses based on the selected stage for a more immersive experience
2. **Conversation History**: Add the ability to maintain conversation context
3. **Feedback Mechanism**: Allow users to rate responses and provide feedback
4. **Improve Prompts**: Refine your system prompts to better align with Spiral Dynamics stages

### 2. Visual Enhancements

1. **Stage-Specific Visuals**: Add visual indicators that reflect the active stage
2. **Interactive Spiral Map**: Create an interactive visualization of the spiral that users can explore
3. **Animated Transitions**: Add subtle animations when switching between stages and modes
4. **Responsive Design Improvements**: Ensure optimal experience on all device sizes

### 3. Content and Educational Features

1. **Stage Explanations**: Expand content about each stage with examples and practical applications
2. **Learning Paths**: Create guided learning journeys through the spiral
3. **Resource Library**: Add a collection of articles, videos, and exercises for each stage
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Show how different AIs embody different aspects of the spiral

### 4. Community Features

1. **User Profiles**: Allow users to save their spiral assessments
2. **Community Forum**: Create a space for discussions about spiral dynamics
3. **Contribution System**: Make it easier for others to contribute content or code
4. **Collaborative Exercises**: Design activities that groups can do together

### 5. Technical Improvements
