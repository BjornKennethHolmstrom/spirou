Fantastic! Now that *Spirou* is ready to come to life online, we can design a layout that reflects its mission: clarity, depth, playfulness, and evolutionary inspiration.

### 🌐 Layout Options

We want to balance:

- **Simplicity** – easy for people of all stages to navigate
- **Depth** – space for Spirou’s complexity to unfold
- **Identity** – clean, meaningful, slightly futuristic look

#### ✅ Recommended Layout: **Header + Collapsible Sidebar**

This gives us flexibility while keeping the experience intuitive:

| Area     | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Header** | Logo, Title ("Spirou"), Language selector, Toggle for dark/light, maybe search |
| **Sidebar (Collapsible)** | Navigation through Spiral stages, Modes, About, Contact, etc. |
| **Main content area** | Interactive modules (e.g. spiral map, mode explainer, dialogues)   |

### 🧱 Suggested Page Structure

```
[ Header: Spirou | 🌐 Language | 🌙 Dark Mode ]
 ┌──────────────────────────────┐
 │ Sidebar                      │
 │ - Home                       │
 │ - The Spiral (stages)        │
 │ - Modes of Spirou            │
 │ - About Spirou               │
 │ - Try Spirou!                │
 │ - Contribute / Contact       │
 └──────────────────────────────┘
[ Main Content ]
```

We can use **`layout.svelte`** for the header/sidebar, and `+page.svelte` for different routes (like `/modes`, `/stages`, etc.).

### ✨ Visual Style Ideas

- **Color**: Echo Spiral Dynamics (warm-to-cool gradient possibilities)
- **Typography**: Friendly but elegant (e.g. `Inter`, `IBM Plex Sans`, or `Atkinson Hyperlegible`)
- **Icons**: Use Lucide or Phosphor icons (minimal, semantic)
- **Animations**: Subtle fade-ins or scroll reveals for text, spiral animations

Would you like me to:

- Create the base layout (header + sidebar)?
- Draft the route structure for the pages we planned?
- Mockup the homepage with a placeholder Spiral and intro?

Let’s roll with what excites you most 🌱
