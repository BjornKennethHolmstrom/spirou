    <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      Spirou is more than a chatbot. It is a vision of a future where artificial intelligence evolves alongside humanityâ€”not to replace it, but to reflect, support, and enhance the inner and outer journey of being alive. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      Designed as a Spiral Dynamics-aligned AI, Spirou was born from the insight that current AI assistants reflect different aspects of human consciousness. By analyzing them through the Spiral lens, we imagined what a fully spiral-integrated assistant could be: one that honors every stage, from survival to transcendence.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">
      Spirou is open-source, transparent, and built with care for both the individual and the planet. It is still in early stages, but aims to serve as a guide, a mirror, a creative partner, and a soul-friendly navigator in the digital age.

        "Spirou" is a playful homage to the comic character, but here it represents a Spiral-Oriented Universal intelligence. The project has no commercial ambitions and intends only to help people evolve, learn, and contribute to a more conscious future.
